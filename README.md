# MorseTextHandler
C Program to decode and encode Morse Code via File Reading or Command Prompt

This C Program is used to decode and encode Morse Text. 
The user simply has to select ehich option they prefer to use. 
If the user decides to use file reading, the names of the files are "inputMorse.txt" and "inputText.txt".
In a later version of the program, I intend not to ask the user for the file name anymore. 

The program uses binary trees in order to decode morse text and doubly-linked lists to encode it. 
The usage of such data structures has provided the opportunity to use the computer momemory in a dynamic way and not be prevented when extra memory is needed.
